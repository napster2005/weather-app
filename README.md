# weather-app
Today, I built a simple Weather App using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! 🌍⛅ This app fetches real-time weather data using an API and displays details like temperature, humidity, and weather conditions based on the user’s location or a searched city.  Features: ✅ User can search for any city 🌎 ✅ Displays temperature, weather condition, and humidity
